    // Java has several reference types such as Class, Interface,Enum, Record,etc
    // Interface is one of the types that you can create in Java that can help implement complex logic concisely
    // Annotations can be defined just like a class and then can be used with @AnnotationName
    // For example, @Override, @Test, @Before, @After
