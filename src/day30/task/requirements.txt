University Course Management
Objective:
Develop a Java program to manage university courses, instructors, and student enrollments.
Class Hierarchy and Requirements:

Person (Superclass):
Instance Variables (private):
name (String): The person's name.
email (String): The person's email address.
Constructor:
Initializes name and email.
Methods:
toString(): Returns a string representation of the person's name and email.

Instructor (Subclass of Person):
Additional Instance Variable:
department (String): The department to which the instructor belongs.
Constructor:
Calls the superclass constructor and initializes department.
Method Overriding:
Override toString(): Include instructor-specific details (department).

Course (Class):
Instance Variables:
courseName (String): The name of the course.
courseCode (String): The code of the course.
instructor (Instructor): The instructor teaching the course.
maxEnrollment (Integer): The maximum number of students that can enroll.
currentEnrollment (Integer): The current number of enrolled students.
Constructor:
Initializes all instance variables.
Methods:
addStudent(): Increments currentEnrollment by 1 if maxEnrollment is not reached.
toString(): Returns a string representation of the course details, including the instructor's name.

Main Method Logic:
Create an array to store Course objects.
Add courses to the array, each with an instructor and course details.
Loop through the array to display the details of each course.
Simulate adding students to some courses and show updated enrollment numbers.
